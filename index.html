                <p>The United Nations Environment Programme issued the following news release:</p>             
                <p>World Rhino Day on 22 September celebrates the world's five species of rhinoceros. It is an opportunity to take stock of global poaching activities ahead of the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London on 11 and 12 October.</p>
                <p>"Rhino calf found cowering alongside mother killed for her horns by ivory poachers in South Africa."</p>
                <h2>These kind of headlines</h2>
                <p>This one from a newspaper on 31 August 2018 - are shocking and may be helping to change mindsets on poaching, but more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of the scourge: poverty and unemployment among burgeoning populations, weak judicial systems and a seemingly insatiable demand for rhino horn products.</p>

                <p>There have been substantial increases in rhino poaching in Africa in the past 10 years - according to official reports, 1,338 rhinos were killed for their horn across Africa in 2015, the worst on record, and in 2016 the figure is believed to have fallen slightly, but poaching continues to be at an unacceptable level (IUCN, 2016). Black rhino populations are precariously low, hovering around 5,000.</p>
                <p>The lives of those working hard to protect endangered wildlife are also at risk; in the last year, over 100 rangers have died in the line of duty, many at the hands of poachers (International Ranger Federation, 2017). Rangers in African countries are beginning to share experiences to improve their anti-poaching techniques.</p>
